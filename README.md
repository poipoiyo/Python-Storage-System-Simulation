There are two file, one is to manage the data, and the other is to view the collection.

The window might be fixed to more concise and more blanks for user to enter in the future. 

# Installation #

python 3.7 and Anaconda for virtual condition.

# Description

----------

There are four bottons can be pressed.   

The first one is use the item's name to find if it exists in the depository or not.   

The second and third is to purchase and sell items. The system will check if the stuff was in the database or not If it exists, system computes the amount again.   

The final one is to refresh the collection. Once users save  in or take out stuffs, the collection should be different. Making it automatically is a goal I can improve.
